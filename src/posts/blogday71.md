I've been on break from school but have continued to code everyday. I wanted to post my final project in Mod 1 here.
It's far from perfect but it's what I could do in the time we were given.
Tic-tac-toe https://sme93.github.io/ticTacToe/

I started working on a flashcards project that runs in the terminal - it's my first time actually writing tests, which is
kind-of exciting. I've also been trying to work through Javascript 30 but tbh I haven't gotten as far as I would like to.


For the rest of today I'm going to work through the Cardio Array project in Javascript 30 and then call it a day.
