<Layout>

Did some trouble shooting this afternoon with my project partner, trying to get
HTML to render to the page with my scripts.js. It was cool when I finally realized why there were commas printing out onto the page in between my recipes and remembering I need to use join when I'm mapping through arrays to make HTML. I also spent some time trying to use Object.keys, Object.values and Object.entries to solve a problem and didn't get very far. I'm going to give myself the extra assignment with our current project to make a new object out of all of our filter tags and then display how many of each tag there is, which I think I can pull off with a reduce and some Object headaches.

Time for dinner. Have a good night!
