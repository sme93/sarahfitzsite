I spent yesterday reviewing Javascript If Statements, and I learned about Ternary Operators
and Switch Statements. I also bought and set up this domain using a Gatsby template.


Today I worked on function review on codecademy. I learned about default parameters,
return statements, function expressions and arrow functions.


Currently reviewing some html stuff so I can write this blog post.


I listened to a mix of Thee Oh Sees and Stephen Malkmus.
