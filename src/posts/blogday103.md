Keeping it simple with Codewars, flashcards and some IronFe practice. Here's a good Codewars example using split and join.

```JS
function fireFight(s){
 return s.split('Fire').join('~~')
}
```

The point here being to replace all the instances of the word Fire with ~~. I tried using replaceAll() but codewars wasn't having it so
I found this solution instead. It looks like some people did use it in their solutions so I was probably doing it wrong.

I also worked on the Marvel Universe dataset, which is an object filled with objects. To use any of the array prototype methods
you have to use Object.keys first and then use bracket notation to access the objects inside.

School starts again tomorrow so I'm taking the rest of the day off to relax my brain before all the learning begins again.
