Tried to go back to doing some double dataset array prototype exercises this morning after taking a few days off and it's crazy how easy it is to forget how to
code. I'm hoping I can finish up my class project this weekend so that I can start back with just doing the exercises going everyday until my mid-"mod" test. I did basically use my solution for one of my exercises almost verbatim in my project this afternoon, which was kinda cool. We have a bunch of tags to filter recipes by on the website, and our inspo site has how many of each recipe is tagged like that, so I copied it for our site with a little reduce action.

It's FRIDAY! I can't believe how fast this week flew by.
