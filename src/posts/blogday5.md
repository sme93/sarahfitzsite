import Layout from "../components/layout"

<Layout>

Taking it easy today. Learned about adding the layout component to my blog posts, and also
updated links in the footer. Exciting stuff. Apparently line spacing matters when you are using react in markdown.

```

import Layout from "../components/layout"

<Layout>

```

At first I didn't have spaces between my import line and the layout tag and I was getting a lot of errors.
Once I added the space it worked!

No music today. See you tomorrow.

</Layout>
