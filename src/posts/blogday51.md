I wanted to do a blog post for my halfway point, but day 51 will have to do! It was a tough week at school but I guess I'm still doing this.
Currently working on a project with two other classmates. Today and yesterday I was working on adding favoriting functionality to the app. I'm going to keep
going a little bit tonight and make it so you can toggle on and off looking at just the favorited cards. It really is just the most exciting stuff, right?

Anyway, here's the link to our github repository if you want to look at the code. https://github.com/sme93/ideabox-boilerplate

The project is due on Tuesday but we are really moving along. I'm hoping we can dial in the CSS and make sure our HTML is a11y accessible before we
turn the project in.

Have a good weekend!
