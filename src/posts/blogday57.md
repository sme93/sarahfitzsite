Hey! I've been really bad about updating my blog while school is going on. I finished up my group project earlier this week,
and this morning I passed the first hurdle to getting into the next "mod."

Here's the link to our deployed group project!

https://sme93.github.io/ideabox-boilerplate/


It's best to view it on a computer since we haven't gotten to the point where we are formatting for
phone screens (soon, soon).

This morning I worked through some test driven development problems and this afternoon I will be writing the HTML for my next
solo project - making a tic tac toe game.

Hoping to do some updates to my site and this blog once my first course is over at the end of next week! I'll post
my last project here next Wednesday, but feel free to keep up with my #100DaysofCode over on my twiiter, @sme.
