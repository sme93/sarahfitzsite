Since I'll be starting school on Monday I'm dialing how much time I spend on coding. This program is supposed to be intense so I kinda want a little break
before it kicks off. I'm still committed to doing the #100days though so I want to spend at least an hour everyday doing some coding.

Today I worked on the next lesson in Javascript on Codecademy, but it was about the differences between ES5 and ES6, and wasn't actually a lot of coding. I
switched over to doing my HTML lessons from Turing and I made some buttons in HTML. I have no idea if this right, but it worked ok on CodePen. ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Here's what I've got -
```HTML
<form action="" method="get">
  <p>Artist name:
    <select name="Music Genre">
      <option value="Pop">Pop</option>
      <option value="Jazz">Jazz</option>
      <option value="Rock">Rock</option>
      <option value="Experimental">Experimental</option></p>
      <input type="text" name="Artist name"/>
  </select>
  <input type="submit"/>
</form>
```
Oh man, I'm sure that is not written right, but it worked on CodePen.
Here's the link to see what it looks like there:

First time doing drop downs and buttons! The excitement is overwhelming.

I listened to thee oh sees and other related stuff while I was coding today.
