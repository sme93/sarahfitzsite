<Layout>

This morning I read a few more chapters on HTML, made a boatload of HTML flashcards, and started reading about CSS. I am supposed to add
some CSS to the HTML page I made yesterday, and I would also see if I can figure out how to link to some photos on that page as well.
I can use Google Photos to host the photos, but I need to figure out how to use CSS to change the size and make them look good on the page.

This afternoon I wrote CSS to style the HTML I wrote yesterday. I'm hoping to add the whole thing to my hiking posts page, but probably won't get
to that til this weekend.

Here's the CSS I wrote, but for some reason I can't actually get it to work so I can't check to see how it looks. We'll see if I can fix it
tomorrow.

```CSS
h1, h3 {
    color: rgb(3, 54, 121);
    background-color:whitesmoke;
    font-family: serif;
}

body {
    font-family: sans-serif;
}

.emphasis {
    font-style:italic;
}

img.align-left {
    float: left;
    width:fit-content;
    height:fit-content;
}
```

I listened to Cannonball Adderley and Bill Evans while I was coding today.
