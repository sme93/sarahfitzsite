First official day of school! Spent some time after class working on navigating around my command line, making and deleting new directories and files,  and learning a few new commands.

mv - moves files

cp - copies files cp[source][destination]

man - manual lookup

pbcopy - copy - pbcopy < [file]

pbpaste - paste - pbpaste > [file]

pretty cool.

I also created variables and reviewed data types in Javascript. Today I learned about the null data type vs the undefined data type. Null is a placeholder for no value, and undefined is a default value if something has not been defined.

Another note I took today is this var color = "magenta"; should be read out loud as the variable color is assigned to magenta.

I know that seems pretty boring and easy but it was good to review all the terminal stuff.

I'm listening to Angel Olsen's All Mirrors album while I code today.
