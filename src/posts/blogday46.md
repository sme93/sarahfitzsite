I finished my affirmation/mantra project and I wanted to link it here. Check it out!

Had a tough time figuring out how to get the error message to pop up if you don't select a radio button in the Add Your Own Message form. I
originally had an event.preventDefault running on the button, but that was preventing the radio button error message from popping up. It was overriding the HTML form validation. So I fixed it by putting the event.preventDefault on the form, which worked out great.

Ok. I just realized that I didn't do a README for my project so I need to get that done. ‚úåüèΩ
