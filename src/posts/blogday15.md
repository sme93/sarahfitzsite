Started in on my Day 1 of the recommended pre-work for the bootcamp I'm starting in a week and a half. There was a little bit of
textbook reading and then they wanted us to do a very simple HTML page, see below. I'm not exactly sure if all my
indentations are correct (actually I'm pretty sure they aren't) but the book I was using wasn't really clear on
where those go.

```HTML
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Sky Pond Hike</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hike to Sky Pond</h1>
        <h3>8.5 miles/1,761 ft elevation gain</h3>  
        <p>Sky Pond is one of our favorite hikes. There is a very misleading sign
        right before you ascend the waterfall portion, leading many hikers to think
        that the lake at the top of the waterfall is Sky Pond. It is not, it's the Lake of
        Glass. Continue up and to the right of the Lake of Glass and you will find
        the trail up to Sky Pond. The first two times we made it to the Lake of
        Glass we thought we had reached Sky Pond and stopped there. It's totally
        worth it to continue on to see the cathedral spires above Sky Pond.</p>
        <p>We decided to make our hike up to Sky Pond our First Hike of the Year and headed
        up there on New Year's Day. The snow on the trail was packed, so we were fine going up with just
        microspikes. The ranger at the trailhead warned us that there was some danger of avalanche as you
        approach Timberline Falls, so we were wary on our way up, but we didn't see any of the danger signs.
        The falls were completely frozen and the climb up was cold, but not wet. Once we got to the top of the falls
        we were able to walk across Lake of Glass and bypass some of the trail, since that was also completely frozen.
        Once we made it to Sky Pond we did some celebratory burpees on the ice and then headed back down. It
        was a beautiful, sunny, but cold day.

I plan on using that as a basis for one of my hiking posts, with photos.
Now that I'm done with HTML for the day I'll head over to codecademy and do some Javascript review.
